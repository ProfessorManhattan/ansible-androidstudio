v0.9.0:
  date: "2017-07-03"
  changes:
    - all unit tests now use assert instead of should
    - remove `fileSize` helper in favor of new `bytes` helper, which does the same thing, but returns `B` instead of `byte` or `bytes`.
    - JSONParse helper is no longer a block helper. It now returns an object, which can be used as a subexpression to achieve the same behavior as before.
    - adds better error handling for path helpers, since node.js errors are terrible. We have a better way to handle errors that will be implemented in a near future release.

    - moves `truncate` helper from `html` helpers to string helpers
    - moves `reverse` helper from `string` helpers to array helpers
    - differentiate `eq` and `is` helpers so that `eq` is strict equality and `is` is not

The module also provides an user interface which uses a WebSocket creating a live stream of log messages. You can use this user interface to look at the logs of your application without needing to login to the actual box.","stars":23,"forks":4,"list":"Play1 Framework","language":"Java","url":"https://github.com/feliperazeek/log4play","homepage":"http://geeks.aretotally.in/log4play-log4j-ui-mashed-up-with-play-framework-knockout-js-and-websockets","topics":[],"list_url":"https://github.com/PerfectCarl/awesome-play1","license":"Unknown"},{"id":"8M46nkHjcz2Q3JTM1iGi","name":"FlexiblePageControl","description":"A flexible UIPageControl like Instagram.","stars":801,"forks":108,"list":"Swift","language":"Swift","url":"https://github.com/shima11/FlexiblePageControl","homepage":"","topics":["carthage","cocoapods","instagram","ios","swift","uipagecontrol"],"list_url":"https://github.com/matteocrippa/awesome-swift","license":"MIT License"},{"id":"8M6LCCACcGYqhYDh4ybP","name":"elemon","description":"live-reload Electron application during development","stars":73,"forks":5,"list":"Electron","language":"JavaScript","url":"https://github.com/manidlou/elemon","homepage":"","topics":["electron","live-reload"],"list_url":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron","license":"MIT License"},{"id":"8MD5m5oJZPho8aOFRwfk","name":"MITMf","description":"Framework for Man-In-The-Middle attacks","stars":3569,"forks":1058,"list":"Hacking","language":"Python","url":"https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/MITMf","homepage":null,"topics":["framework","man-in-the-middle","mitm","python"],"list_url":"https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-pentest","license":"GNU General Public License v3.0"},{"id":"8MHmYeN0XkOPv4TwluHm","name":"eclipse-transpiler-plugin","description":"Eclipse plugin to automatically transpile your files (LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript, etc.).","stars":21,"forks":4,"list":"Less","language":"Java","url":"https://github.com/gossi/eclipse-transpiler-plugin","homepage":null,"topics":[],"list_url":"https://github.com/LucasBassetti/awesome-less","license":"MIT License"},{"id":"8MJWUFGQNk0iMilFmoep","name":"awesome-community","description":"A curated list of awesome programming, development, technical support and discussion channels, groups, communities, resources and other shiny things","stars":257,"forks":41,"list":"Communities","language":null,"url":"https://github.com/phpearth/awesome-community","homepage":"","topics":["awesome","community","groups"],"list_url":"https://github.com/filipelinhares/awesome-slack","license":"Unknown"},{"id":"8MJjCsRD3DIGehiFMig1","name":"changelog-generator","description":"GitHub Action to generate changelogs, release notes, whatever","stars":140,"forks":32,"list":"GitHub Actions","language":"JavaScript","url":"https://github.com/metcalfc/changelog-generator","homepage":"","topics":["changelogs","cicd","github-actions","release-notes"],"list_url":"https://github.com/sdras/awesome-actions","license":"MIT License"},{"id":"8MKMSbimiMRtHRFeinVQ","name":"ECheck","description":"Small tool to validate epub files for macOS.

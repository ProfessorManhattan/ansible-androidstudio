    desc: Symlink to an environment in the `environments/` folder
    summary: |
      # Symlink an environment's contents to the root

      This method is convienience method for symlinking all of the folders in
      `environments/prod/`, for instance. You can pass the environment as a CLI
      argument or you can use an interactive prompt.

      **Example opening a prompt:**
      `task environment`

      **Example using CLI argument:**
      `task environment -- prod`

      - task: ansible:playbook:environment

  group:exec:
    desc: Execute group commands on any group (including repositories in sub-groups)
    summary: |
      # Run commands on multiple repositories in parallel

      This command requires that the `GITLAB_TOKEN` environment variable be set. With the
      token defined, you can use this task to run scripts on repositories that fall under
      any given group or sub-group. By default, it runs the script(s) on all the
      repositories in the specified group and sub-groups.

      You can use this task to perform adhoc bulk changes to large numbers of
      repositories that are hosted on GitLab.

      **Example usage:**
      `task group:exec -- group/subgroup ---- 'bash <(curl https://myscript.com)'

      In the example above, the bash command will be run in the root of each repository.
    cmds:
      - task: git:gitlab:group:exec

  init:
    desc: Ensures project is initialized with upstream files and migrates pre-existing projects
    summary: |
      # Initialize the project and run the full update sequence

      This command will mostly not be needed for pre-existing projects. This task begins
      by calling a script that:

      1. Migrates legacy projects
      2. Fixes common errors
      3. Ensures the project is initialized
      4. Prompts for missing metadata
      5. Runs the `start` task

      If you are facing difficulties, you can try running this task to reset the project,
      perform common fixes, and run the whole start up routine.
    cmds:
      - git init

        if [ -n "$GITLAB_CI" ]; then

      # Speed up future development by preloading common system applications

      Just about every development task requires some sort of globally installed
      application. TypeScript requires Node.js to be installed. Ansible requires
      a handful of CLIs (and Python). This task will check for missing applications
      and install them globally. If you do not run this task, the routines will
      assume you want to keep the footprint small and use disposable virtual
      environments whenever possible (i.e. `\{{.NPX_PACKAGE}}` in the case of Node.js,
      `poetry` in the case of Python, etc.).

      ## Reboot Requirements

      Some software that is installed, like VirtualBox and Docker, require reboots so
      it is recommended that you reboot after running this task.

      ## Passwordless Installation

      This installation method and all the methods we use will only prompt for a sudo
      password when absolutely necessary. If you already have common development tools
      it is possible that you will not even have to enter a sudo password. This is
      accomplished by installing to `$HOME/.local/bin` whenever a traditionally system
      level binary is installed. However, if you are missing something like git, then
      chances are you will be asked for a sudo password. In this case, we recommend
      you adopt the Megabyte Labs philosophy and inspect the code before running it.

  prepare:
    desc: Prepares the project for the normal start command
    summary: |
      # Prepare the project

      This task ensures the project has all the required metadata. If a project
      is missing required metadata then this task will interactively prompt the user
      for the missing data. It also performs miscellaneous tasks that are sometimes
      required by the `start` task.

  scripts:
    interactive: true
    deps:

    desc: Run and view descriptions for `npm scripts` via an interactive dialog
    summary: |
      # Interactively select scripts defined in package.json

      Our projects use `run` (a fork of task) to handle most of the task running.
      However, in some projects there may be scripts defined in package.json. This
      task is a convienience method that will present a list of scripts alongside
      their descriptions that you can interactively launch.

  services:
    desc: Update elements of the repository that require API access
    summary: |
      # Update elements of the repository that require API access

      This task will ensure that the git repositories and other services related to the
      project are updated with the proper configurations. It requires that certain
      API keys be set. Generally, only project owners will use this task.
    cmds:
      - task: common:update:services

  start:
    desc: Set up the project and refresh it with the latest changes
    summary: |
      # Start the project

      This task will scaffold the project with the latest upstream changes
      and ensure your development environment has all the dependencies installed.

      This command should be used whenever the files that are automatically generated
      need to be updated. It also serves as an entry point for new developers who
      are getting started with the project.

      **Example usage:**
      `task start`
    cmds:
      - task: {{#eq group "common"}}upstream:{{#eq subgroup "shared"}}shared{{else}}common{{/eq}}{{else}}{{#eq group "documentation"}}upstream:{{#eq subgroup "shared"}}commondocs{{else}}docs{{/eq}}{{else}}upstream:project{{/eq}}{{/eq}}

  test:
    interactive: true
    desc: Open an interactive dialog to select and run a Molecule test
    summary: |
      # Test Ansible plays

      This task wraps all the supported test methods for Ansible plays into a
      convienient multi-question prompt system that supports:

      1. Docker tests
      2. Headless VirtualBox tests
      3. VirtualBox Desktop tests which are not automatically destroyed
      4. Running the play locally
      5. Running the play over SSH on a remote target

      - task: ansible:test:prompt

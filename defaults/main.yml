# @var android_sdks: []
# The list of SDKs and tools to install after Android Studio is installed. If no value is
# provided, the latest version of the SDKs and tools will be installed. Use the correct
# format, which can be found by executing `sdkmanage --list` after the CLI tools are
# installed; some package need a version to be specified and some do not.
# @example #
# android_sdks:
#   - platform-tools
#   - emulator
#   - build-tools;30.0.0
#   - platforms;android-30
#   - sources;android-30
#   - patcher;v4
# @end
android_sdks: []

# @var sdk_location: ""
# The folder to set as the SDK location
# @example #
# sdk_location: ~/Android/Sdk
# @end
sdk_location: ~/Android/Sdk

# @var user_configs: []
# The `user_configs` variable is an array of objects that should, at the very
# least have the `username` property defined for each user with a home directory
# that you would like this role to install the Android SDK tools into. If the
# system property is set to true, then the SDK tools will not be installed to that
# user's home directory. You can control the installation location with the `sdk_location`
# variable.
# @example #
# user_configs:
#   - username: myuser
#   - username: root
#     system: true
# @end

# @brief Runs an Ansible play on a GitLab CI shared Windows runner
#
# @description
# This PowerShell script prepares a GitLab CI shared Windows runner to test an
# Ansible play for Windows compatibility. Since Ansible cannot run on Windows,
# it uses Docker to run the play on the Windows host. Both Chocolatey and Docker
# come preinstalled on the shared runner. The script performs the following tasks
# in order:
#
# 1. Installs Python 3 via Chocolatey
# 2. Changes the administrator password to AnsibleTest999 since it is unknown
# 3. Sets up WinRM CredSSP which Ansible connects with since SSH is currently not a viable option for
#    connecting to the Windows host from a child Docker container. The script this step uses is an
#    official example of how to set up WinRM on Windows for Ansible.
# 4. Runs the Ansible play via Docker which then performs the remaining steps by running a seperate shell script.
#
# This script is called by a [GitLab CI job](https://gitlab.com/megabyte-labs/ci/gitlab-ci-templates/-/blob/master/test/windows-ansible.gitlab-ci.yml).

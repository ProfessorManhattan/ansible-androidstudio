# Shared Taskfiles

All of the taskfiles in this folder are kept in sync with the [Shared common file repository](https://gitlab.com/megabyte-labs/common/shared). If you need to make a change to any of the taskfiles, open the PR against the Shared common file repository. Once the PR is merged, the taskfiles will propagate down to the project-type specific common file repositories and then down to the project repositories.

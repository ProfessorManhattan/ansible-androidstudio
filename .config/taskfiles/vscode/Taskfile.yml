      # Generates the `.vscode/extensions.json` file for VS Code auto plugin recommendations

      This task generates the `.vscode/extensions.json` file which is used to automatically have
      VS Code show a popup with a link that leads to a list of plugins that the project recommends.
      This list is populated by converting the list of VS Code plugins installed by default by
      [Gas Station](https://gitlab.com/megabyte-labs/gas-station) into VS Code syntax.

      # Populate the `.vscode/tasks.json` file

      This task populates the `.vscode/tasks.json` file with tasks that are viewable by
      running `task --list`. With the file generated using the output from `tasks --list`,
      the user can then easily run any of the tasks from within VS Code.

      This is a simple implementation. There are many features provided by VS Code that we
      can potentially leverage to make our `tasks.json` better and more useful to developers.

      # Switch environments using an interactive dialogue

      Ansible does not really provide any great ways to switch between environments (or sets of
      `host_vars/`, `group_vars/` etc.). If you place all the files and folders you wish to constitute
      as an environment inside a folder named as the name of the environment then you can use
      this task to handle the symlinking and switching between environments.

      **Example of opening the interactive prompt:**
      `task ansible:environment`

      **You can directly switch enironments to `environments/prod/` by running:**
      `task ansible:environment -- prod`

      - task: environment:{{if .CLI_ARGS}}cli{{else}}prompt{{end}}

        # Symlink Environment

        Answer the prompt below to switch between environments. Each environment
        should be a folder with folders and files you wish to link to from the root
        of the project. They should normally consist of a host_vars, group_vars,
        inventory, and files folder (but can contain any files/folders you wish to link).
        Each environment should have its own folder in the `environments/` folder titled
        as the name of the environment. After you select an answer, the script will
        symlink all of the items in the environments folder to the root as long as there
        is not anything except a symlink to the target location (i.e. it will overwrite
        symlinks but not files).

      # Find roles that are missing any given file

      This task scans through all the folders in the roles/ directory and checks
      for the presence of a file that you pass in through the CLI.

      **Example usage:**
      `task find-missing -- logo.png`

      The example above will look through all the folders two levels deep (e.g. `./roles/tools/nmap`,
      `./roles/system/snapd`) in the roles folder and display any roles that are missing the file.

      # Ensures each role is added as a remote

      This task cycles through all the roles in the `/roles` folder and ensures
      they are added as remotes. This helps with managing the git trees used
      for combining the many role repositories into the playbook mono-repository.

      It also adds a remote for a private submodule that is intended to store
      files that are not meant to be shared. The remote is named `private`.

        These set of prompts will run the `main.yml` playbook after you specify:

        1. The "environment"

        The environment is a collection of folders that should, at the very minimum,
        include "files", "group_vars", "host_vars", and "inventories". Each folder in
        the "environments" folder constitutes a different environment. By using
        environments, you can seperate different sets of variables/files or even seperate
        your private variables out into a sub-module.

        2. An inventory file

        The Ansible inventory stored in the "inventories" folder. This will generally be
        a YML file with host connection information that also correlates the inventory with
        the proper host_vars and group_vars. It is assumed that your sudo username and
        password are encrypted inside the inventory (via "ansible-vault").

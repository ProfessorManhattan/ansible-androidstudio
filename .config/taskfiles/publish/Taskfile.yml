      # Run Semantic Release

      If `setup.cfg` is present, then the project is assumed to be a legacy Python
      project that needs to run in environment with access to the `python-semantic`
      extras defined in `pyproject.toml`.

      If `meta/main.yml` is defined, then the project is assumed to be an Ansible
      project that requires Python dependencies to be installed and accessible by
      prefixing the `semantic-release` CLI command with `poetry run`.
    vars:
      RELEASE_PREFIX:
        sh: if [ -f setup.cfg ] || [ -f meta/main.yml ]; then echo 'poetry run '; else echo ''; fi

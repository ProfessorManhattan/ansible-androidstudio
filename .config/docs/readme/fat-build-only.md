### Building a Slim Container

Some of our repositories support creating a slim build via [DockerSlim](https://gitlab.com/megabyte-labs/ansible-roles/dockerslim). According to [DockerSlim's GitHub page](https://github.com/docker-slim/docker-slim), slimming down containers reduces the final image size and improves the security of the image by reducing the attack surface. It makes sense to create a slim build for anything that supports it, including Alpine images. On their GitHub page, they report that some images can be reduced in size by up to 448.76X. This means that if your image is naturally **700MB** then it **can be reduced to 1.56MB**! It works by removing everything that is unnecessary in the container image.

This repository, however, is not currently configured to build a slim build. If you think you can improve this container by making it smaller and more secure by utilizing DockerSlim, please check out our [CONTRIBUTING.md guide]({{ repository.group.dockerfile }}/{{ subgroup }}/{{ slug }}/-/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and open a pull request. Once you come up with the options for the slim build, place them in `.blueprint.json` under the key `"dockerslim_command"` and then run `bash .start.sh`. When `.start.sh` is run, it will add useful build commands to the `package.json` file and even regenerate this README to reflect the fact that the repository houses a slim build. You can find an example of a repository that houses a slim build by checking out our [Updater container]({{ repository.group.dockerfile_ci }}/updater).

## Roles

This project breaks down every piece of software into a role (found in the subdirectories of the `roles/` folder). Below is a quick description of what each role does. Browsing through this list, along with the conditions laid out in `main.yml`, you will be able to get a better picture of what software will be installed by the default `main.yml` playbook.

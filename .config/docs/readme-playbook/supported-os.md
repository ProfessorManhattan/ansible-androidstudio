## Supported Operating Systems

The following chart shows the operating systems that have been tested for compatibility using the `environments/dev/` environment. This chart is automatically generated using the Ansible Molecule tests you can view in the `molecule/default/` folder. We currently have logic in place to automatically handle the testing of Windows, Mac OS X, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Debian, and Archlinux. If your operating system is not listed but is a variant of one of the systems we test (i.e. a Debian-flavored system or a RedHat-flavored system) then it might still work.

## Issues Fixed

<!--
Use GitLab syntax to link this merge request to the issue(s) it fixes. For example, in this section, you can write:

`Fixes #434` or `Closes #4, #6, Related to #5`

Adding a related issue will link the issue in the GitLab web GUI but it will not mark the issue to be automatically closed when the merge request is merged.

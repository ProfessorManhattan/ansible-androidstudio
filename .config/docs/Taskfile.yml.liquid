tasks:
  build:
    desc: Build the project
    summary: |
      # Build the project

      Use this command to build the project. It executes the command defined
      in `package.json` under the `.blueprint.build_command` key.

      You can ensure all the proper keys are setup in `.blueprint.build_command`
      by running `task init` which will prompt you to enter required fields
      that are not present.
    cmds:
      - task: go:build

  commit:
    deps:
      - install:software:git
    desc: Add all and commit
    summary: |
      # Commit the code

      By default, this task is an alias for:

      ```
      git add --all
      git commit
      ```

      If you pass a commit message as a CLI argument, then the pre-commit
      logic will be bypassed. By bypassing the hooks, the commit message will be
      excluded from the automatic CHANGELOG.md entry generated during commits.
      Passing the commit message as a CLI argument can be done like so:

      ```
      task commit -- "Added new files that do not need to show up in CHANGELOG.md"
      ```
  cmds:
    - |
      {{if .CLI_ARGS}}
      git add --all
      HUSKY=0 git commit -m "{{.CLI_ARGS}}" --no-verify
      {{else}}
      git add --all
      git commit
      {{end}}

  environment:
    interactive: true
    desc: Symlink to an environment in the `environments/` folder
    summary: |
      # Symlink an environment's contents to the root

      This method is convienience method for symlinking all of the folders in
      `environments/prod/`, for instance. You can pass the environment as a CLI
      argument or you can use an interactive prompt.

      **Example opening a prompt:**
      `task environment`

      **Example using CLI argument:**
      `task environment -- prod`
    cmds:
      - task: ansible:playbook:environment
{{/eq}}
  fix:
    desc: Run code auto-fixers
    summary: |
      # Auto-fix code

      This task will automatically apply lint fixes across the whole project using
      auto-fixers. Although unlikely, it is possible that auto-fixing can introduce
      an error so the auto-fixes still have to be validated.
    cmds:
      - fix:all

  group:exec:
    desc: Execute group commands on any GitLab group (including repositories in sub-groups)
    summary: |
      # Run commands on multiple repositories in parallel

      This command requires that the `GITLAB_TOKEN` environment variable be set. With the
      token defined, you can use this task to run scripts on repositories that fall under
      any given group or sub-group. By default, it runs the script(s) on all the
      repositories in the specified group and sub-groups.

      You can use this task to perform adhoc bulk changes to large numbers of
      repositories that are hosted on GitLab.

      **Example usage:**
      `task group:exec -- group/subgroup ---- 'bash <(curl https://myscript.com)'

      In the example above, the bash command will be run in the root of each repository.
    cmds:
      - task: git:gitlab:group:exec

  init:
    desc: Runs the initialization script
    summary: |
      # Initialize the project and run the full update sequence

      This command will mostly not be needed for pre-existing projects. This task begins
      by calling a script that:

      1. Migrates legacy projects
      2. Fixes common errors
      3. Ensures the project is initialized
      4. Prompts for missing metadata
      5. Runs the `start` task

      If you are facing difficulties, you can try running this task to reset the project,
      perform common fixes, and run the whole start up routine.
    cmds:
      - git init
      - |
        if [ -n "$GITLAB_CI" ]; then
          if [ -n "$UPDATE_INIT_SCRIPT" ]; then curl -s "$UPDATE_INIT_SCRIPT" | bash; fi
        else
          bash <(curl -s \{{.INIT_SCRIPT}})
        fi

  lint:
    desc: Lints the project using all error-prone linters
    summary: |
      # Lint the project using most of the linters

      This task will do a project-wide linting using all of the linters that commonly
      report errors. You can use this task to spot linting errors prior to running
      the git pre-commit hooks.

      **Example usage:**
      `task lint`
    cmds:
      - task: lint:all

  livereload:
    deps:
      - install:npm:nodemon
    desc: Start the project with live-reloading (i.e. watch mode)
    summary: |
      # LiveReload the project

      Using LiveReload, you can automatically run the project any time you make
      changes to the project. The LiveReload feature uses [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon)
      with the configuration stored in `.config/nodemon.json`.

      Whenever you make a change to the project, `task project:livereload` will run. You can
      define the command that runs everytime you make a change in the `Taskfile-project.yml`
      `livereload` section. This file is kept intact even across upstream propagation updates,
      unlike the regular `Taskfile.yml`.

      **Example usage:**
      `task livereload`

      The default configuration (in `.config/nodemon.json`) is generic and makes assumptions
      about the file types to watch based on what type project it is. If you would like to
      use a different configuration, you can pass in the location of the configuration like so:

      **Example with custom configuration:**
      `task livereload -- nodemon.custom.json`

      The task program also provides a `--watch` feature. However, it relies on the `sources` attribute
      being defined so it might not work in all cases.

      **Example using `task --watch`:**
      `task --watch mytask`
    log:
      start: Starting `nodemon` live-reload session
    cmds:
      - |
        if [ ! -f Taskfile-project.yml ]; then
          .config/log error '`Taskfile-project.yml` must exist and have a `livereload` task to use with `nodemon`' && exit 1
        fi
      - nodemon --config \{{if .CLI_ARGS}}\{{.CLI_ARGS}}\{{else}}.config/nodemon.json\{{end}}

  playbook:
    desc: Run the playbook
    summary: |
      # Run the playbook

      This task will prompt you for the environment and inventory you would like to
      run the `main.yml` playbook with. It will:

      1. Symlink all roles in the `roles/` folder to `~/.ansible/roles`
      2. Run `task environment` (which prompts and symlinks the appropriate environment)
      3. Prompt for which inventory to use
      4. Run `ansible-playbook -i inventories/your_choice --ask-vault-pass main.yml`

      **Example usage:**
      `task playbook`

      **Example bypassing prompts, using the `inventories/inventory.yml` file:**
      `task playbook -- inventory.yml`
    cmds:
      - task: ansible:playbook:run

  preload:
    deps:
      - install:brewfile
    desc: Set up your workstation in advance by installing commonly used programs
    summary: |
      # Speed up future development by preloading common system applications

      Just about every development task requires some sort of globally installed
      application. TypeScript requires Node.js to be installed. Ansible requires
      a handful of CLIs (and Python). This task will check for missing applications
      and install them globally. If you do not run this task, the routines will
      assume you want to keep the footprint small and use disposable virtual
      environments whenever possible (i.e. `\{{.NPX_PACKAGE}}` in the case of Node.js,
      `poetry` in the case of Python, etc.).

      ## Reboot Requirements

      Some software that is installed, like VirtualBox and Docker, require reboots so
      it is recommended that you reboot after running this task.

      ## Passwordless Installation

      This installation method and all the methods we use will only prompt for a sudo
      password when absolutely necessary. If you already have common development tools
      it is possible that you will not even have to enter a sudo password. This is
      accomplished by installing to `$HOME/.local/bin` whenever a traditionally system
      level binary is installed. However, if you are missing something like git, then
      chances are you will be asked for a sudo password. In this case, we recommend
      you adopt the Megabyte Labs philosophy and inspect the code before running it.

  prepare:
    desc: Prepares the project for the normal start command
    summary: |
      # Prepare the project

      This task ensures the project has all the required metadata. If a project
      is missing required metadata then this task will interactively prompt the user
      for the missing data. It also performs miscellaneous tasks that are sometimes
      required by the `start` task.

    desc: Run and view descriptions for `npm scripts` via an interactive dialog
    summary: |
      # Interactively select scripts defined in package.json

      Our projects use `run` (a fork of task) to handle most of the task running.
      However, in some projects there may be scripts defined in package.json. This
      task is a convienience method that will present a list of scripts alongside
      their descriptions that you can interactively launch.

  services:
    desc: Update elements of the repository that require API access
    summary: |
      # Update elements of the repository that require API access

      This task will ensure that the git repositories and other services related to the
      project are updated with the proper configurations. It requires that certain
      API keys be set. Generally, only project owners will use this task.
    cmds:
      - task: common:update:services

  shell:
    desc: Start a terminal session using Docker with any Linux operating system
    summary: |
      # Start a Docker terminal session

      Use Docker to run commands on nearly any operating system. The operating
      systems are all stock distros with systemd added.

      The selected environment will mount the current working directory to the
      Docker container.

      **Example opening an interactive prompt:**
      `task shell`

      **Example of directly shelling into a container:**
      `task shell -- ubuntu-21.04`

      ## Available operating systems (that you can use with the example above):

      * archlinux
      * centos-7
      * centos-8
      * debian-9
      * debian-10
      * fedora-33
      * fedora-34
      * ubuntu-18.04
      * ubuntu-20.04
      * ubuntu-21.04
    cmds:
      - task: common:shell

  start:
    desc: Set up the project and refresh it with the latest changes
    summary: |
      # Start the project

      This task will scaffold the project with the latest upstream changes
      and ensure your development environment has all the dependencies installed.

      This command should be used whenever the files that are automatically generated
      need to be updated. It also serves as an entry point for new developers who
      are getting started with the project.

      **Example usage:**
      `task start`
    cmds:
      - task: {{#eq group "common"}}upstream:{{#eq subgroup "shared"}}shared{{else}}common{{/eq}}{{else}}{{#eq group "documentation"}}upstream:{{#eq subgroup "shared"}}commondocs{{else}}docs{{/eq}}{{else}}upstream:project{{/eq}}{{/eq}}

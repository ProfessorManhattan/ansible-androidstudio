      # Symlink each role to `~/.ansible/roles/{{.GALAXY_NAMESPACE}}.{{'{{'}}role_name{{'}}'}}`

      In the playbook, roles are sometimes referred to by their folder name and in other cases
      they are referred to with their namespace prepended (e.g. `{{.GALAXY_NAMESPACE}}.{{'{{'}}role_name{{'}}'}}`).
      This can cause issues so, in order for everything to work, each folder needs to be symlinked
      to `~/.ansible/roles` with the namespace prepended.

    summary: |
      # Symlink this role to `~/.ansible/roles/{{.ROLE_NAME}}`

      Roles are sometimes referred to by their folder name (which ideally is also the role_name in
      the `{{.META_PATH}}` file) and they are sometimes referred to by their Ansible Galaxy name which
      has the namespace prepended (e.g. `{{.ROLE_NAME}}`). In order to make sure Ansible
      can find the role in both cases, a symlink in `~/.ansible/roles` that points to the folder needs
      to be created.

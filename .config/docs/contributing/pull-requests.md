## Pull Requests

All pull requests should be associated with issues. Although not strictly required, the pull requests should be made to [the GitLab repository issues board]({{ repository.gitlab }}{{ repository.location.issues.gitlab }}) instead of the [GitHub mirror repository]({{ repository.github }}{{ repository.location.issues.github}}). This is because we use GitLab as our primary repository and mirror the changes to GitHub for the community.

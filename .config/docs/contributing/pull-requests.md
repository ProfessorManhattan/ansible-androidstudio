## Pull Requests

All pull requests should be associated with issues. You can find the [issues board on GitLab]({{ repository.group.dockerfile }}/{{ subgroup }}/{{ slug }}/-/issues). The pull requests should be made to [the GitLab repository]({{ repository.group.dockerfile }}/{{ subgroup }}/{{ slug }}) instead of the [GitHub repository]({{ profile.github }}/docker-{{ slug }}). This is because we use GitLab as our primary repository and mirror the changes to GitHub for the community.

### How to Commit Code

Instead of using `git commit`, we prefer that you use `npm run commit`. You will understand why when you try it but basically it streamlines the commit process and helps us generate better CHANGELOG files.

### Pre-Commit Hook

Even if you decide not to use `npm run commit`, you will see that `git commit` behaves differently because there is a pre-commit hook that installs automatically after you run `npm i` (or `bash .start.sh`). This pre-commit hook is there to test your code before committing and help you become a better coder. If you need to bypass the pre-commit hook, then you may add the `--no-verify` tag at the end of your `git commit` command (e.g. `git commit -m "Commit" --no-verify`).

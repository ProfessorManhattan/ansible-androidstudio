# Megabyte Labs Ecosystem

This project incorporates design patterns from the [Megabyte Labs](https://megabyte.space) ecosystem. The ecosystem is a set of repositories that integrate with one another through CI/CD. The repositories share configurations, common documentation partials, and developer tools. The ecosystem's main goals are to:

1. Keep projects up-to-date
2. Make the management of large amounts of repositories easy
3. Be prepared by implementing development features before they are necessary (within reason)
4. Maximize developer efficiency
5. Improve developer onboarding by providing the tools necessary to adhere to the design patterns of the ecosystem with minimal oversight
6. Serve and provide an example of a bleeding-edge, production-ready full-stack development platform

## Language Support

There are currently boilerplates and templates written in the following languages:

* TypeScript (primary language)
* Python
* Go

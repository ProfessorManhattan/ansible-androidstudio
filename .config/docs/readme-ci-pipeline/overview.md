## Overview

Utilizing Continuous Integration (CI) tools can improve developer efficiency drastically. They allow you to do things like scan new code for possible errors and automatically deploy new software.

This repository is home to the build instructions for a Docker container that is just one piece to the CI puzzle. Nearly all of [our CI pipeline Docker projects](https://gitlab.com/megabyte-labs/dockerfile/ci-pipeline) serve a single purpose.

Instead of using one of the countless {{ pretty_name }} public Docker images available, we create it in-house so we know exactly what code is present in the container. We also ensure that all of our CI pipeline images are as small as possible so that our CI environment can download and run the specific task as quickly as possible. Using this repository as a base, you too can easily create your own in-house CI pipeline container image.

At first glance, you might notice that there are many files in this repository. Nearly all the files and folders that have a period prepended to them are development configurations. The tools that these files and folders configure are meant to make development easier and faster. They are also meant to improve team development by forcing developers to follow strict standards so that the same design patterns are used across all of our repositories.
